# Database WBL
This course introduces students to the concept of the database system and how it can be used in daily human life and profession. The focus of the course is to equip students with knowledge and skills on important steps and techniques used in developing a database, especially in the conceptual and logical database design phase. Among topics covered are database environment, database design, entity relationship diagram, normalisation, and structured query language (SQL). Students will be taught to use a database management system (DBMS). Students are required to work on a project, i.e. to develop a database application system, for a selected organisation. In this project, students are required to work closely with the organisation during the process of analysis, designing and implementing the system and to use the learned techniques, DBMS and development tools in the development process. At the end of the course, students should be able to apply the knowledge of designing and developing a good database system for a real-world problem.

## About Us
The information on this Github is part of the materials for the subject database WBL (SECP2523). This folder contains general big data information as well as big data case studies using Malaysian datasets. This case study was created by a [Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Engineering)](https://comp.utm.my/secph/), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia student.

## Tools
Diagrams are visual representations of information or data that help convey complex concepts, processes or systems in a clear and concise manner. Flowcharts are diagrams that use shapes and arrows to illustrate the steps in a process or algorithm [**[More info...]**](https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/tools.md).
